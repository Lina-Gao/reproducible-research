# Reproducible Research Information

This repository provides resources for reproducible research.
It was created to help our team move towards reproducible research in our work as Knight Cancer Institute Biostatistics Shared Resource members and as statisticians in our other roles.

# Slides

A .Rmd file that generated a slide deck on reproducible research can be found at this link:

[slides-info-reproducible-research/repro-research-summary.Rmd](slides-info-reproducible-research/repro-research-summary.Rmd)

This was initially presented at a meeting for BSR members on April 20, 2016. It will be continually updated and more lessons will be added to this repository.
