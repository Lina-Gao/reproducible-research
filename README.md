# Reproducible Research

This repository provides resources for reproducible research.
It was created to help our team move towards reproducible research in our work as Knight Cancer Institute Biostatistics Shared Resource members and as statisticians in our other roles.

## Materials

### Intro to reproducible research

### Study Group

In 2016, BSR held a weekly study group to learn more reproducible research tools. We studied the following books:

- [Reproducible Research with R and RStudio – Gandrud](https://www.crcpress.com/Reproducible-Research-with-R-and-R-Studio/Gandrud/p/book/9781466572843)
- [Implementing Reproducible Research – Stodden, Leisch, Peng](https://www.crcpress.com/Implementing-Reproducible-Research/Stodden-Leisch-Peng/p/book/9781466561595)

The slides and other information are in the folder: [slides-info=reproducible-research/study-group-2016/](slides-info=reproducible-research/study-group-2016/)
